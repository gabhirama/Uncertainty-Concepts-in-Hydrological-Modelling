Surface Water Hydrology AG60201 Term Paper

This term paper is a part of the course Surface Water Hydrology AG60201, a four-credit course taught by Prof. Rajendra Singh, Agricultural and Food Engineering Department, IIT Kharagpur. We were supposed to research and present our ideas on a specific domain of Hydrology. The class consisted of 21 students, and we could select from 14 topics. I have chosen the topic - UNCERTAINTY ANALYSIS IN HYDROLOGY.

The reason for me choosing this is because I am a data science aspirant, and understanding the reasons for uncertainty in model predictions could help me get a better understanding of how models work in a technical and a philosophical aspect (I know it sounds exaggerating, but trust me there's a lot of philosophy behind arrangement and working towards reducing uncertainty in hydrological models).

I have attached the original term paper and the presentation following it. This work took me a month and a half to research and four days to write while I was on a train travelling to Kharagpur. The expected audience is anyone interested in ecological modelling, Machine and Deep Learning and Risk modelling enthusiasts.

Thank you
